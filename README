A self-authored and maintained content management system.
I have omitted the required DB schema to prevent unauthorized re-use of this CMS.
Please review the "INSTALL" text for basic installation instructions.

Notes about the application:

- This CMS is used by many businesses and myself.
    See a demo/example: http://www.aaroncaryl.com/

- "Applets" & "Apps" are Objects utilizing an MVC structure.
    They are meant to be customized & expanded upon.

- "Common" is a library of 3rd party (uninstantiated) scripts readily available throughout the CMS.
    Consider this a warehouse for all the miscellaneous scripts and libraries needed.

- "Core" is the system code that shouldn't be modified.

- "Logs" are... logs.

- "Templates" are re-usable HTML/CSS/JS/etc. templates.
    They are meant to be customized and expanded upon.

- "Uploads" (and its children) are system-writable file-space.
