A self-authored and maintained content management system.
Please review the "INSTALL" text for basic installation instructions.

Notes:
- See an "in the wild" demo/example of this CMS:
    http://www.sa.buffalo.edu/          University at Buffalo Student Association website
    http://www.advtelehealth.com/       Advantage Home Telehealth website

- "Applets" & "Apps" are Objects utilizing an MVC structure.
    They are meant to be customized & expanded upon.

- "Common" is a library of 3rd party (uninstantiated) scripts readily available throughout the CMS.
    Consider this a warehouse for all the miscellaneous scripts and libraries needed.

- "Core" is the system code that shouldn't be modified.

- "Logs" are... logs.

- "Templates" are re-usable HTML/CSS/JS/etc. templates.
    They are meant to be customized and expanded upon.

- "Uploads" (and its children) are system-writable file-space.

- Last but not least... I have omitted the required DB schema to prevent unauthorized use of this CMS.
