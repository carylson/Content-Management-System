A self-authored and maintained content management system.
I have omitted the required DB schema to prevent unauthorized re-use of this CMS.
Please review the "INSTALL" text for basic installaion instructions.

Notes:
- "Applets" & "Apps" are objects adhering to an MVC structure. They are meant to be customized & expanded upon.
- "Common" is a library of 3rd party uninstantiated scripts readily available throughout the CMS.
- "Core" is the system code that shouldn't be modified.
- "Logs" are... logs.
- "Templates" are re-usable HTML/CSS/JS/etc. templates. They are meant to be customized and expanded upon.
- "Uploads" (and its children) are system-writable filespaces.
